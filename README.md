Hi folks

Project Name: Weather App  üå¶Ô∏è

Description:
I have developed a weather forecast application, the Weather App, using Kotlin in the Android Studio environment. 

This project allows users to obtain detailed weather information for a specific city.

Key Features:

Location and Current Information:

The app utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain geographical coordinates based on the city name provided by the user.

These coordinates are then used to fetch current weather data, including temperature, weather description, maximum and minimum for the day, among others.

Weekly Forecast:

In addition to current information, the app displays a weekly forecast, showing minimum and maximum temperatures for each day of the week.

Attractive and Responsive Interface:

The user interface is designed to be pleasant and intuitive, providing a smooth and engaging experience for users.

Technologies Used:

Language:
Kotlin

Android Studio

Retrofit for communication with the OpenWeatherMap API

Lottie for loading animations

Technical Highlight:

The project stands out for its efficient architecture, use of asynchronous API calls to ensure a smooth user experience,
and a responsive and attractive implementation.

Next Steps:
I am open to suggestions and continuous improvements. I plan to implement additional features such as the ability to save favorite cities,
weather notifications, and enhancements to the user interface.


By sharing this project, I am seeking opportunities to apply and enhance my skills as an Android developer.

I am open to feedback and eager to contribute to the success of innovative projects. Thank you for the opportunity! üöÄ
